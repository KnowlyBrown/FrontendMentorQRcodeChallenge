### What I learned

I didn't realize I would find it difficult to center my div... i ran into an issue earlier because I didn't use the translate property. Glad I was able to uderstand how that works and can easily do it now.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css#:~:text=To%20center%20a%20div%20horizontally,equally%20between%20the%20two%20margins.) - This helped me for the issue of positioning my div like I said above.
